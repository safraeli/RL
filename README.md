## Udacity RL - First Exercise

The submission includes three files:
* model.py - code for definning the NN
* dqn_agent.py - code with the class Agent
* Navigation.ipynb - code for trainning the model 

Note that the two py files were taken as-is with minor changes to meet the different envrironment from the sample DQN code provided as part of the Deep Q-Networks lesson.

The Notebook file was changed to:
1. Different environment (unity instead of gim)
2. Slightly different code for training the Agent
